# URL-Shortener

A custom URL Shortener.
The purpose of this project is to showcase the use of MongoDB database, using nano-id library and effectively using the directories - controller, routes, models, middlewares and service to segregate the code as much as possible.

This also showcases the basic implementation of cookies during authentication.
